# MFM-JS

### Moveable Feast Machine simulator built in JavaScript

---

The idea here is not to port MFM to JavaScript, but instead simulate it enough and provide an environment that is easy to quickly get hands-on with robust-first programming.

Prerequisites

- nodejs 8.10.0+ (_I use nvm to easily manage and upgrade node versions_) (https://nodejs.org)
- an IDE like VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Install

- git clone https://github.com/walpolea/MFM-JS.git
- `cd MFM-JS`
- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- serve up index.html to view in browser
  - you can `npm install -g http-server`
  - and then `http-server ./dist`
